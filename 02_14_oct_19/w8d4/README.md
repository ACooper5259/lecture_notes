Intro to Ruby
===

As always, thanks for today - the engagement is awesome!

[Here's link to the code with wrote; I included our irb command history as well](https://github.com/hafbau/lecture_notes/tree/master/02_14_oct_19/w8d3)

## What have we learnt so far?

- Programming Language is overrated
- Ecosystem is huge
- You can learn a new language in a weekend ... or not?

## Why might we be a polyglot

- Legacy: Experience the real world
  - New framework and/or language
- Job: Mo' moni mo' codin'
- Curiosity | Fun
- YOLO
- Different mental models/paradigms (Class based vs Prototype based OOP)


## Comparing Ruby && JS

- Scripting (Ruby && JS) VS high-level programming language
- Compiled (Ruby && JS) vs interpreted
- Dynamic (Ruby && JS) vs Static

## In the wild
Ruby is used for cross-platform computer applications.

  - Vagrant
  - Homebrew


Ruby is also used for web development

  - Rails
  - Basecamp
  - AirBnB
  - Github
  - Hulu
  - more!
  - Discourse
  - Jekyll
  - Sass
