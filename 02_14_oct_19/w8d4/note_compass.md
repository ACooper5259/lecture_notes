Thanks folks for your engagement today! We explored Ruby at a conceptual level, why some things are the way they are. We drew parallels with Javascript appreciating the differences and relishing the similarities. Dom's notes and Travis' notes below gives a decent overview of the things we went through and others we did not (like more OOP stuff).
