Crud with Express
===

Hey gang, thanks for sitting through today. Our focus today was on the process / workflow of how you begin to write a full web application. We started by planning our ~million~ billion dollar idea; Coffee Run. When we are satisfied, we started designing our RESTful routes (Method + Path). We talked about the trinity of our web server logic:

- Routes / Route Handlers
- Data access / storage
- Views / Pages the user sees

We also wrote our code with modularity in mind, fostering habits we've seen earlier. Separating our route handlers, data access/storage and views into their respective files/directories.

Have a look at the code we wrote here.

I've also included another instructor's demo code here for completeness.

Also, here is note that touched upon some of the details we discussed and more. (Shout out to Nima)
