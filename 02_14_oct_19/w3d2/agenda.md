Crud with Express
===

Hey gang, thanks for sitting through today. Our focus today was on the process / workflow of how you begin to write a full web application. We started by planning our ~~million~~ billion dollar idea; Coffee Run. When we are satisfied, we started designing our RESTful routes (Method + Path). We talked about the trinity of our web server logic:

- Routes / Route Handlers
- Data access / storage
- Views / Pages the user sees

We also wrote our code with modularity in mind, fostering habits we've seen earlier. Separating our route handlers, data access/storage and views into their respective files/directories.

[Have a look at the code we wrote here.](https://github.com/hafbau/lecture_notes/tree/master/02_14_oct_19/w3d2)

[I've also included another instructor's demo code here for completeness.](https://github.com/hafbau/lecture_notes/tree/master/02_14_oct_19/w3d2/nima)

[Also, here is note that touched upon some of the details we discussed and more.](https://github.com/NimaBoscarino/crud-express-notes) (Shout out to Nima)
