[Here's a visualization of pass by reference for non-primitive data types. Made by Andy (another awesome Vancouver instructor)](http://pythontutor.com/javascript.html#code=const%20myObj%20%3D%20%7B%20name%3A%20'Alice'%20%7D%3B%0A%0Aconst%20changeName%20%3D%20function%28obj%29%20%7B%0A%20%20obj.name%20%3D%20'Bob'%3B%0A%20%20console.log%28'inside',%20obj.name%29%3B%0A%7D%3B%0A%0AchangeName%28myObj%29%3B%0Aconsole.log%28'outside',%20myObj.name%29%3B&mode=edit&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=js&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D)

Also, feel free to look at [Dom's (Montreal Lead instructor) awesome notes](https://gist.github.com/DominicTremblay/246f70931394316eaaa81d5a3e6b30d7) (waaaay better than mine), for alternative spins on the things we discussed today.

Thank you!
