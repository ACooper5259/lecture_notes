Hafiz Suara on May 27, 2020

## Today

- Focus on Objects
- 5PM PT - Pair Programming Activity

## Review [20m]

- Reading Code
  + working with legacy code
  + refactoring and debugging
  + using external library
- Arrays
- Functions

## Objects Intro [15m]

- Not yet doing OOP
- Using them as key-value (kv) datastructure
- Benefits of kv data structure?


### Breakouts today [30m]
- Share the gist in slack (https://gist.github.com/hafbau/ffc28b276c621127c4c6b80e51e86e69)
- We take 15m
- Come back when you're done
- We'll do 10m takeup


### Take aways today

- learned that the `for .. in` can loop through both arrays and objects. In case of an array, we get indexes while for objects we get the keys
- defining a function (method) inside an object.
- do not define a variable without the keywords const / let. Even if you can. Not sure why? Please speak to a mentor.
- console.log extension and commenting hotkeys (`CMD + /`)
- arrays and objects within other arrays are referenced rather copied by value
