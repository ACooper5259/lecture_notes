### Take aways today

- Understanding the difference between for .. in and for .. loop.
- learned about `this` within objects or in a function property of an object.
- the importance of learning to practice. Focus on how the JS interpreter will read code - starting from executions points e.g. function calls
- primitives are copied by value while non-primitives (arrays / objects) are copied by reference
- Arrays are good for grouping heterogenous data while objects are suited for data grouped around a peculiar business thing (object).
