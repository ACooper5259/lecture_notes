## Breakout Challenge [30m]

Split into groups and discuss each of these, writing down your solutions.

- 15m breakout
- 10m takeup

- Each group will be called upon to present their answer for one of the questions, you just dont know which.
- Do not split up the questions among your group; go through them together, in order
- Do not run the code. That defeats the point.
- It's okay to google. In fact for some of the questions, you really should.
- I'll check in and give more time if needed.
- No need to fork and/or clone this gist. It's just for you to read together off the screen and write your answers (somewhere, anywhere)
- Decide on who will present the answer when called upon for your group
