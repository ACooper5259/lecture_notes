# W1D3 - Objects in JS

Hey crew,

You folks are ... THE BEST! Thanks for that fun class today. We went over the agenda below:

### Agenda
- [x] Check ins and Review
- [x] Primitive Data Types
- [x] Arrays review
- [x] Objects
- [x] Classwork

The files we worked on (commented with notes) are here.

Here's a visualization of pass by reference for non-primitive data types. Made by Andy (another awesome Vancouver instructor)

Also, feel free to look at Dom's (Montreal Lead instructor) awesome notes (waaaay better than mine), for alternative spins on the things we discussed today.

Thank you!
