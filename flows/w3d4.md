# TODO BEFORE LECTURE

- SETUP THE DEMO PROJECT
  + WITH LOGIN AND REGISTER
  + /USERS ROUTE
- SETUP NOTES.MD
- ADD NEEDED IMAGES
  + HASHING
  + ENCRYPTION IMAGE
  + MAN IN THE MIDDLE ATTACK IMAGE
- READ UP ON SSL / HTTPS
- SETUP THE CLASSWORK ON REST




# DEMO

- Show the app so far:
  + can register
  + can login
  + /users in a secret route
    - passwords in plain text

- Security Issue #1:
 - Storing Passwords - why not plaintext
 - How to encrypt passwords (bcrypt)
 - Crypto Aside: hashing

- Security Issue #2:
  - User can see data in cookie and modify, becoming any other user
  - Solution: encrypt the cookie
  - Crypto Aside: Encryption
  - ADJUST DEMO (use `cookie-session` npm)

- Security Issue #3:
  - Stealing cookies
    - HTTP is plain-text
    - Man-in-the-middle (we know NSA, etc. do this)
    - Firesheep: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firesheep
  - Solution: HTTPS (End-to-End Encryption)
  - Crypto Aside: Public Key Crypto
  - Mention: Lets Encrypt

- Summary:
  - When to use...
    - plain cookies:
      - *almost never use plain cookies*
      - maybe for:
        - language selection
        - shopping cart for non-logged in users
        - analytics
    - encrypted cookies:
      - *do this by default*
      - only store user_id (rest can go in database)
    - server-side sessions
      - *not worth hassle for small projects*
      - if you need to store lots of session data
      - if you frequently change session data
      - you want the ability to invalidate specific users' sessions

  - Types of Cryptography:
    - Hashing (one way): Password Encryption
    - Encryption (two way): Cookie Encryption
    - Public Key Crypto: HTTPS

#### REST and Advanced Express

This portion of the lecture is mainly a survey of RESTful routing for web servers, and an exploration fo more Express-specific patterns and tips (e.g. routers, middleware). These topics are of a lower priority than the discussion on `bcrypt` and encrypted cookies, so only spend 30-45 minutes with the following:

- REST
  - resource based routes convention 
  - industry context and alternatives (maybe)
- Making an express app more manageable
  - organizing resources into modules
  - methodOverride and why it's needed
- Middleware-based extensions to Express (maybe)
  - Review what middleware is
  - Examples of real middleware solutions like [`morgan`](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan), [`method-override`](https://github.com/expressjs/method-override), and the ones we've already used (for cookies, and body parsing)
- REST JSON APIs
  - Review and examples
  - Keep in mind that students have consumed JSON APIs before ([Cats](/cb633b14-2361-411d-9fcc-3033c23fd68a)).
  - How are they built using Express
  - Real world considerations like versioning (again, show examples)
- Alternatives to Express in JS and other ecosystems
  - Show & speak to Sinatra
  - Show & speak to Flask
  - Show & speak to Koa
