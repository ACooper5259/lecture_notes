===

Hafiz Suara / KV on April 28, 2020

## Check audio

## How was yesterday? [5m]

- Assistances experience?
 + How many did you have? in the chats
 + What was it like? Speak to it
- How was Discord experience?
- What can be improved
- Please use your end of day feedback as well
- Don't forget Slack as well

## Talk about Today [5m]

- Focus on Objects
- 5PM PT - Pair Programming Activity
  + How it used to be awkward; we used to do it on week 2
  + We've brought Katas into it, so it doesn't matter what activity you're currently on
  + One today and One tomorrow will be using zoom and the ones next week will be using Discord
  + Will be using VScode Live share

Talk about today's lecture agenda

### Let's talk about reading code [10m]

- Why is it an important skill?
 + Question for someone to speak up? By raising hands.
  - working on legacy
  - refactoring
  - stackoverflow: understanding copy pasted code
  - conferences with code presentation
  - code review sessions at a work place

- It takes time and experience. Developers take for granted how they just know how.
I would share my strategy but I'll to understand what your strategies are?

  + How would you read code? What's your strategy?

- Read like JS interpreter will do it
- Naming helps to give an idea as well
- console.logging sub functions is useful as well
- Keep practicing


### Arrays review [15m]

- create an array
```js
const arr = [1,2, 3, 4, 'hello']

console.log(arr[2]);

arr.push('yo')// mutation (adding yo)

console.log(arr) // expecting 'yo' at the end

// Are we comfortable with this so far?

arr[9] = 'al'

console.log('arr', arr) // what will happen?

What about?

arr[0] = arr[9]; // simple assignment

console.log(arr)

What if I modify arr[0]

arr[0] = 'abc';

console.log(arr)

// Alright kick it up a notch

arr[8] = [1, 2, 3]

console.log('arr', arr) // 9th item present

arr[1] = arr[8]; // second item also an array

console.log('arr', arr)

Now lets modify arr[1]

arr[1].push(4) // are we comfortable with this syntax i.e dot after square brackets?

// How do you even interprete that expression? Question for students

// So its like [1, 2, 3].push(4)

// What should we see now?
// I want to see
// Yes - only the first modified / No - only the first
console.log('arr', arr);


// What could we infer from this? Someone who didn't have that answer?

//- we did not copy data over; we only copied location and the two locations point to the same array

// Questions?

// Let's visualize the execution with python tutor

// - How many things were allocated in memory?

// Inference
// With primitive data types, we copy value. With non-prims, we copy reference

// If this is still fuzzy, note it down and ask a mentor afterwards
```


### Lets talk about Objects [20m]

- It could be confusing if you've got some experience in the past about OOP
- Today not OOP; we're focussed on k/v data
 + How / Why

Let's take a look at file 2

```js
// Example instructors with 3 key pieces of info.

// How would we represent data with different pieces of information?
// - We could have variables for each pieces
//  + But would arrays not be better?
const hs = ['Hafiz Suara', '@hafbau', 'Calgary'];
const kv = ['Khurram Virani', '@kvirani', 'Vancouver'];

const instructors = [
  hs,
  kv
];

// For example how will print all info about all instructors?
for (const instr of instructors) {
  const name = instr[0];
  const slack = instr[1];
  const location = instr[2];
  console.log(`${name} lives in ${location} and goes by ${slack}`)
}
```

# B R E A K

**resume recording and do mic check**

### Objects contd. [15m]

- What's the problem with the data representation we left off with?
  + we are dependent on order of indexes

Lets open `object_example` file

Think of objects as two-columns table in a spreadsheet.

```js
// Bring in code from previous file
const hs = {
  name:
  slack:
  location:
}

console.log(hs.name)
console.log(hs['name'])

// you can think of keys as variables

// and you could set values in an object
hs.name = 'H S'

// you could even nest arrays as values in an object

const al = {
  name,
  location,
  slack,
  langs: ['JS', 'Ruby']// putting arrays in
}

// and vice versa => objects in arrays as well

const instructors = [
  hs,
  al
]

console.log('instructors', instructors)
```

- More objects practice was included in the prep course; feel free to practice the katas if these all feel fuzzy

### Lets move to methods in objects [15m]

- open objects_method
- move over the two objects examples

```js
// you can add functions to objects
const hs = {
  name:
  slack:
  location:
  greet: function() {
    console.log("Hello, I'm Hafiz Suara");
  }
}

// if you're thinking this is cool, you're kinda already familiar with function expression i.e
// const greet = function () {};

// We could even bring it to Andy

// Could we make it so it calls name from the object it's placed in? YES
greet: function() {
  console.log(`Hello, I'm ${name}`);
}
// The above will fail why?
// - no context is why

// So we could do hs.name to give it context
// - that's not okay cos, `hs.` is referencing external variable; also maintenance

// so we'll do `this`

// We could DRY things up but we won't for today - set expectations around Friday curriculum work

// Recap on objects
// this is an object
const hs = {
  name: 'Hafiz suara', // these are properties pointing to values (K -> V)
  slack:
  location:
  // generally call them methods
  greet: function() {// this property is pointing to a function, so (function property)
    console.log("Hello, I'm Hafiz Suara");
  }
}
// Questions?? Comments??
```

## Lets get into breakout [25m]

- Share the gist in slack (https://gist.github.com/hafbau/ffc28b276c621127c4c6b80e51e86e69)
- We take 15m
- Come back when you're done
- We'll do 10m takeup
