Promises with Hafiz
===

## Todo before lecture [15m]

- copy paste a student's Profile generator
- convert it to promises

## Agenda Today

- Quokka.js vscode extension (vscodecandothat.com)

- Set expectation about Promises

- Review of Callbacks (Sync / Async) [10m]

- **Classwork** Agile Manifesto [3 + 10 + 5m](https://github.com/hafbau/w2d4_classwork)
  + Breakout rooms of twos
  + Clone this repo
  + Write your code in the `01_classwork.js`
  + If this is cake walk for you, guide your teammates through it rather than solve it for them
  + Don't sweat it if you don't finish
  + Don't be afraid to slow the team down; you'll be my champion
  + Have fun AND attempt the question

- Callback waterfall (Hell) [5m]
  + Talk about this in light of solutions to this classwork
  + Introduce Fun Profile Generator as example of callback hell

- Intro to promises as a strategy to cope with cb Hell

  + Show Fun Profile Generator Promises (side by side comparison) [15m]

  + What are Promises?
    - Promises are like when you order the Ultimate bowl from Thai Tai; and instead of getting the bowl - they give you a paper.
      + Like an IOU that may eventually  turn to the Bowl or not?
    - They are JS objects that are used to deal with asynchronous flow
    - They can have three states: Pending / Resolved / Rejected
    - They are usually returned from a function but could also be created


- Questions?

[Do it again with classwork](12m??)
- **Classwork** Your turn: Convert the Classwork Agile Manifesto to Promises [15m + 10m]
  + With the same team;
  + Copy paste your earlier solution to a new file
  call it `agile_promises.js`
  + convert to promise version; use `(fs).promises` in place of `(fs)`

  ```js
  // Promises are one of the objects that are Thenable in javascript
  const p1Promise = fs.readFile('data/p1.txt', 'utf8')

  p1Promise
  .then((p1) => {
    finalDoc.push(p1);
    return fs.readFile('data/p2.txt', 'utf8')
  })
  .then((p2) => {
    finalDoc.push(p2);
    return fs.readFile('data/p3.txt', 'utf8')
  })
  .then((p3) => {
    finalDoc.push(p3);
    return fs.readFile('data/p4.txt', 'utf8')
  })
  .then((p4) => {
    finalDoc.push(p4);
    console.log(finalDoc.join("\n"))
  })
  ```


- More Promises [40m]
      + Error handling
        - In my journey to ThaiTai, a lot can go wrong; same way reading the agile manifesto could lead to errors
        - mistype a file name being read e.g. `p12.txt`
        - show a catchAll
         + one breaks, subsequents skipped
        - show catch individual

      + Promise.all

        ```js
        const p1Promise = fs.readFile('data/p1.txt', 'utf8')
        const p2Promise = fs.readFile('data/p2.txt', 'utf8')
        const p3Promise = fs.readFile('data/p3.txt', 'utf8')
        const p4Promise = fs.readFile('data/p4.txt', 'utf8')

        const allPromises = [
          p2Promise,
          p3Promise,
          p4Promise
        ]

        // takes an array of promises
        const pAll = Promise.all(allPromises)
        .then(resolvedValues => {
          // returns an arry of resolved values
          console.log('resolvedValues', resolvedValues)
        },
        err => {
        console.log('Shot fired');
        })

        console.log('pAll :>> ', pAll);
        ```

      + Promise.race - use agileManifesto

      ```js
      const p1Promise = fs.readFile('data/p1.txt', 'utf8')
      const p2Promise = fs.readFile('data/p2.txt', 'utf8')
      const p3Promise = fs.readFile('data/p.txt', 'utf8')
      const p4Promise = fs.readFile('data/p4.txt', 'utf8')

      const allPromises = [
        p1Promise,
        p2Promise,
        p3Promise,
        p4Promise
      ]

      Promise.race(allPromises)
      .then(trollResult => {
        console.log('trollResult :>> ', trollResult);
      })
      ```

      + Make a promise
        - example with simple values resolved and rejected

        ```js
        // 1. Resolving simple value
        const futureIsBright = new Promise((resolve) => {
          resolve('all good');
        })

        futureIsBright.then(resolvedValue => {
          console.log('resolvedValue :>> ', resolvedValue);
        })

        console.log('futureIsBright :>> ', futureIsBright);
        // 2. Rejecting simple value
        const futureIsBright = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
          reject('bs! its all lies');
        })

        futureIsBright
        .then(resolvedValue => {
          console.log('resolvedValue :>> ', resolvedValue);
        })
        .catch(err => console.log('err :>> ', err))

        // 3. Conditional Resolving / Rejecting simple values
        const futureIsBright = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
          // this only rejects! Once it rejected, it can't later be resolved.
          reject('bs! its all lies');
          resolve("Better believe it!");
        })

        futureIsBright
          .then(resolvedValue => {
            console.log('resolvedValue :>> ', resolvedValue);
          })
          .catch(err => console.log('err :>> ', err))
        ```

        How are we feeling?
        - example wrapping `fs.readFile`
        - example promisifying `fs.readFile`; reusable


- Do it together Quick [10m]
      - [Quiz](https://gist.github.com/hafbau/d6a023b7aff7f0dae80c11d4c23ec026)
      - We're going to do this together
      - everyone put their guesses in the chats
      - We run the code;
      - Whoever gets it explains why.
