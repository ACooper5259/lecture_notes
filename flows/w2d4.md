Promises with Hafiz
===

## Agenda Today

- Set expectation about Promises

- Review of Callbacks (Sync / Async) [5m]

- **Classwork** Agile Manifesto [3 + 10 + 5m](https://github.com/hafbau/w2d4_classwork)
  + Breakout rooms of twos
  + Clone this repo
  + Solve only `01_classwork.js`

- Callback waterfall (Hell) [5m]
  + Talk about this in light of solutions to this classwork
  + Introduce Fun Profile Generator as example of callback hell

- Intro to promises as a strategy to cope with cb Hell
  + What are Promises?
    - Promises are like when you order the Ultimate bowl from Thai Tai; and instead of getting the bowl - they give you a paper.
      + Like an IOU that may eventually  turn to the Bowl or not?
    - They are JS objects that are used to deal with asynchronous flow
    - They can have three states: Pending / Resolved / Rejected
    - They are usually returned from a function but could also be created

- Refactor Fun Profile Generator to Promises [15m]

- Questions?

- **Classwork** Your turn: Convert the Classwork Agile Manifesto to Promises [15m + 10m]
  + With the same team;
  + Copy paste your earlier solution to a new file
  call it `agile_promises.js`
  + convert to promise version; use `(fs).promises` in place of `(fs)`


- More Promises [40m]
      + Error handling
        - In my journey to ThaiTai, a lot can go wrong; same way reading the agile manifesto could lead to errors
        - mistype a file name being read e.g. `p12.txt`
        - [DO NOT USE]use ThaiTai example; `buyBowl`, `eatBowl`, `disposePackaging`

      + Promise.all / Promise.race - use agileManifesto

      + Make a promise
        - example with simple values resolved and rejected

        How are we feeling?
        - example wrapping `fs.readFile`
        - example promisifying `fs.readFile`; reusable


- Do it together Quick [10m]
      - [Quiz](https://gist.github.com/hafbau/d6a023b7aff7f0dae80c11d4c23ec026)
      - We're going to do this together
      - everyone put their guesses in the chats
      - We run the code;
      - Whoever gets it explains why.
