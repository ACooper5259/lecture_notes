**Review Async with Settimeout** [10m]

**Lets talk about Networking and communication** [5m]

Hot tips for VERBAL communication
- Introduce yourself
- figure out if the same lang.
- handshake
- make sure they're not asleep
- find out what they do
- one speak the other listen
- end it cleanly


**What is a protocol?**

* It's a formalized way to communicate.
    - Spoken language is a communications protocol, as is body language! But we're getting philosophical here...
* In computer science, it's a set of rules defining a way for two systems to communicate in a way both can make sense of what's going on.

**The web is like a lasagna of protocols** [5m]

* At the bottom layer there's **IP** -> _Internet Protocol_
* On top of it there's **TCP** -> _Transmission Control Protocol_
* And on top that we have **HTTP** -> _Hyper Text Transfer Protocol_
* There are other protocols
    - **FTP** -> _File Transfer Protocol_
    - **SMTP** -> _Simple Mail Transfer Protocol_
    - **XMPP** -> _Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol_ (used by Slack!)
    - **SSH** -> _Secure Shell_
    - ...and hundreds of others

*Things to google:*

- OSI Models
- TCP/IP model



**Servers** [5m]

- Applications that communicate over a network
- Answer to requests on a specific IP address and port
- For every IP, only **one** server can be listening on a given port
    + You **can** have multiple servers listening on different ports on the same IP
- Different application protocols use different ports (65,536 total)
    + HTTP: 80 / HTTPS: 443
    + FTP: 21
    + SMTP: 25
    + SSH: 22


**TCP - Demo** [30m]

- Goal is to create a console chat application. This include a server code and client code.
  - Test with two clients
  - Test with the class (ngrok)

1. Create a `server.js` and a `client.js` file. And open them side by side; each one with it's own terminal

2. What should our `server.js` do
  - creates a tcp server
  - listen for connection
    + on receipt of a new connection, sends the connected client a welcome message
      - then listen for any data subsequently sent through that connection
        + on receipt of any data, broadcast that data to all currently connected clients

  ```js
  // create a server
  // listen for connections on a particular port
  // on connection send a Welcome message to every client
    // set client encooding (do we even speak the same language???)
  // listen for message from client
  // on receiving a message broadcast to other connected clients
  // on client disconnect say something

  const net = require('net');
  // console.log('net :>> ', net);
  const server = net.createServer();

  const allClients = [];

  server.on('connection', (client) => {
    console.log('Yay!!! a client connected');

    allClients.push(client);

    client.setEncoding('utf-8');
    client.write('Welcome to Jumanji!!!🥁🥁🥁')

    client.on('data', (message) => {
      console.log('Message from client', message);

      allClients.forEach(cl => {
        if (cl !== client) {
          cl.write(message)
        }
      })
    })

    client.on('close', () => console.log('a client disconnected'))
  })

  server.listen(8080, () => console.log("Server Listening on port", 8080))
  ```

3. What should our `client.js` do
  - create a tcp connection to our server
    + with `port` and `host`
  - it set it's encoding i.e. how the it interprets server's messages
  - When `connect`-ed, console.log('your connected')
  - Whenever it receives (`data`) message from server, it should display that message to console
  - Whenever we type something to console, it should send what we typed to the server

  ```js
  // create a connection with
  // host =>> ip address
  // port
  // set what their encoding is (my language)
  // listen for connection acknowledgment
    // listen for data / message from the server
    // write some message to server

  const net = require('net');

  const client = net.createConnection({
    host: 'localhost',//'192.168.168.234',
    port: 8080
  })

  client.setEncoding('utf-8')

  client.on('connect', () => {
    console.log('Yo! Im connected yall');
  })

  client.on('data', (message) => {
    console.log('Message from server', message);
  })


  // What channel? console => process.stdin
  // when something is being typed to stdin aka when there's data on stdin,
  // send that data to server

  process.stdin.on('data', (messageFromConsole) => {
    client.write(messageFromConsole)
  })
  ```

**HTTP** [20m]

* It's the way browsers talk to servers
* It's very simple: just some text structured in a specific way
* It's a **client-server** protocol
    - The **client** makes **requests**
    - The server returns **responses**

**HTTP clients**

- Browsers
- curl
- postman
- code based client e.g using a library (request)

>
> Every request has only one response
>


**Requests** is made from clients and composed of:
- url
- method (GET POST PUT DELETE) CRUD / BREAD
- headers
- body

**Responses** is from the server to a particular request

- status / codes (100s - info, 200s - good, 300s - redirected, 400s - Bad request, 500s - server error)
- headers
- body
