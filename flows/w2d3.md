**Review Async with Settimeout** [10m]

**Lets talk about Networking and communication** [5m]

Hot tips for VERBAL communication
- Introduce yourself
- figure out if the same lang.
- handshake
- make sure they're not asleep
- find out what they do
- one speak the other listen


**What is a protocol?**

* It's a formalized way to communicate.
    - Spoken language is a communications protocol, as is body language! But we're getting philosophical here...
* In computer science, it's a set of rules defining a way for two systems to communicate in a way both can make sense of what's going on.

**The web is like a lasagna of protocols** [5m]

* At the bottom layer there's **IP** -> _Internet Protocol_
* On top of it there's **TCP** -> _Transmission Control Protocol_
* And on top that we have **HTTP** -> _Hyper Text Transfer Protocol_
* There are other protocols
    - **FTP** -> _File Transfer Protocol_
    - **SMTP** -> _Simple Mail Transfer Protocol_
    - **XMPP** -> _Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol_ (used by Slack!)
    - **SSH** -> _Secure Shell_
    - ...and hundreds of others



**Servers** [5m]

- Applications that communicate over a network
- Answer to requests on a specific IP address and port
- For every IP, only **one** server can be listening on a given port
    + You **can** have multiple servers listening on different ports on the same IP
- Different protocols use different ports
    + HTTP: 80 / HTTPS: 443
    + FTP: 21
    + SMTP: 25
    + SSH: 22


**TCP - Demo** [30m]

- Goal is to create a console chat application. This include a server code and client code.
  - Test with two clients
  - Test with the class

1. Create a `server.js` and a `client.js` file. And open them side by side; each one with it's own terminal

2. What should our `server.js` do
  - creates a tcp server
  - listen for connection
    + on receipt of a new connection, sends the connected client a welcome message
      - then listen for any data subsequently sent through that connection
        + on receipt of any data, broadcast that data to all currently connected clients

3. What should our `client.js` do
  - create a tcp connection to our server
    + with `port` and `host`
  - it set it's encoding i.e. how the it interprets server's messages
  - When `connect`-ed, console.log('your connected')
  - Whenever it receives (`data`) message from server, it should display that message to console
  - Whenever we type something to console, it should send what we typed to the server


**HTTP**

* It's the way browsers talk to servers
* It's very simple: just some text structured in a specific way
* It's a **client-server** protocol
    - The **client** makes **requests**
    - The server returns **responses**

**Requests** is made from clients and composed of:

- url
- method
- headers
- body

**Responses** is from the server to a particular request

- status
- body
- headers
