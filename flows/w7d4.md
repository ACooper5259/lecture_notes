## Review of Hooks [10m]

- **What are the most important things we know about hooks?**
  + They are functions
  + They are called within a component
  + They are not embedded within any logic e.g. if / for loops
  + Their names start with `use`
  + We've seen useState && useEffect

## Why Custom Hooks [15m]

From React Docs (https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html):

> Building your own Hooks lets you extract component logic into reusable functions.

We can pull repetitive or complex code out of our components and move it into custom hooks

- Show two screen components each with different Titles

```js
export default function CuriousCat() {
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = 'The App - curious cat';
  }, [])
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Oh hey, I'm the curious cat, meow</h2>
      <img alt="curious cat" src="https://www.lovethispic.com/uploaded_images/8851-Curious-Cat.jpg?2" />
    </>
  )
}
```

```js
export default function DodgyDog() {
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = 'The App - dodgy dog';
  }, [])
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Wazzaaa, I'm the dodgy dog, snoooop</h2>
      <img alt="dodgy dog" src="https://i.redd.it/yfnw4c86chmz.jpg" />
      <img alt="dodgy dog" src="https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2014/05/alex_co.jpg" />

      <em>Stop judging, its legal</em>
    </>
  )
}
```

- Do the refactoring

*But what are they*

- Custom hooks are just JavaScript functions that can use React hooks
- They must start with the prefix use so that React knows they are hooks
- Multiple components using the same custom hook **do not share state**

> We just built half a library.
> react-helmet use to do this stuff.

## Custom Hooks Examples

### useMousePosition [20m]

- Start with App.jsx; uncomment this group
- Demo the features
  + Displays x, y coords
  + Colors a text based of x, y coords
  + custom circle cursor (reference ATB's?)

- Walkthrough the code of the three features
  + use split screens (code + browser side by side??)
- Refactor WETness to hooks folder
  + Test it still works

  ```js
  const useMousePosition = () => {
    const [coords, setCoords] = React.useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

    React.useEffect(() => {
      const handler = (event) => {
        const x = event.clientX;
        const y = event.clientY;
        setCoords({ x, y });
      };
      document.addEventListener('mousemove', handler);
      return () => { document.removeEventListener('mousemove', handler) }
    }, []);

    return coords;
  };
  ```

- Questions??

### useRequest [20m]

- There's a good chance we'll be making api requests from different components
- In these api requests, three states are usually being tracked: **Loading**, **Success** or **Error**
- We could factor all the logic in a custom hook
- Open the `components_with_requests` (these components are needy) folder.
- Folder includes three files (only show index.jsx for now):
  + ListDogs (use masonry)
  + DogProfile
  + index.jsx -  ties it all together
- Uncomment this group of components in App.jsx
- Demo how it works
- Quick walkthroughs of how ListDogs && DogProfile code works
- With focus on the WETness of the api request logic
- Refactor into useRequest
 + copy one of the logic into the `hooks` folder
 + factor out the dynamic parts

**RESUME RECORDING**

## Testing Hooks

### Test useMousePosition [25m]

- open the skeleton test
- introduce react-testing library
  + go to documentation
  + focus on `renderHooks` and what it returns
  + talk about `act` and why
- write pseudocode of what we're testing
  + initial state
  + moved state (can we trigger mousemove in code esp in test?)
- write initial test and run it

```js
import { renderHook } from '@testing-library/react-hooks';
import useMousePosition from '../useMousePosition';

test('should return an x key with an integer value', () => {
  const { result } = renderHook(() => useMousePosition());
  expect(result.current).toHaveProperty('x');
  expect(typeof result.current.x).toBe('number');
});

test('should return a y key with an integer value', () => {
  const { result } = renderHook(() => useMousePosition());
  expect(result.current).toHaveProperty('y');
  expect(typeof result.current.y).toBe('number');
});

test('should return a updated coords when mouse moves', () => {
  const event = new MouseEvent("mousemove", { clientX: 50, clientY: 100 })
  const {
    result
  } = renderHook(() => useMousePosition());

  act(() => { document.dispatchEvent(event) });
  
  expect(result.current.y).toBe(100);
  expect(result.current.x).toBe(50);
});
```

- Questions??
- write the second test and run it.
- **How are we feeling?**


### TDD
Now that we're realizing that custom hooks trumps WET logic and are getting in the groove of things. Let's attempt to create a custom hook from get go.

#### useInput [25m]

- open the skeleton test file
- pseudocode specs for useInput
  + takes a default value
  + returns current value and an onChange function
  + can change based on event

```js
import { renderHook, act } from '@testing-library/react-hooks';
import useInput from '../useInput';

test('should start with initial value', () => {
  const initialValue = 'hello world';
  const { result } = renderHook(() => useInput(initialValue));
  const [ value ] = result.current;
  expect(value).toBe(initialValue);
});

test('should be updateable with a new value', () => {
  const newValue = 'something new';
  const fakeEvent = { target: { value: newValue } };
  const { result } = renderHook(() => useInput(''));
  const onChange = result.current[1];
  act(() => onChange(fakeEvent));
  const value = result.current[0];
  expect(value).toBe(newValue);
});
```
