## Object Challenge (Elite) Leet Speak
Implement a simple cipher which takes in word and returns a 1337 version of word.

h => 4
e => 3
t => 7
l => 1
o => 0

**Error Driven Development**

```js
function yeetSpeak(word) {
  let convertedWord = '';
  for (const letter of word) {
    if (letter in yeetMap) {
      convertedWord += yeetMap[letter];
    } else {
      convertedWord += letter;
    }
  }
  return convertedWord;
}
```

Key concepts
- could loop through a string
- how to check if a key exists in an object
- pattern of init => process => return
  + type of initialization determines types of processing possible

## functions as value
- creates greet function that takes `name` variable
- consolelog the variable vs consoleloging the function call
- assign it into another variable
- show that it points to the same function using python tutor
- we just treated function as a value
- functions are `first class citizens in JS`

## function passed into functions

```js
// If functions are values, they can be passed around, can we pass them to functions?

const f = function () {
  return 5;
};

const anotherFunc = function(func) {
  console.log(func)
}

// What will this print
anotherFunc(f);

// then this?
anotherFunc(f());
```
- Realized we can also pass functions into other functions

## The problem callback solves

```js
// Before we explore callbacks, lets see a problem first

// Start with: Print each to the screen

const names = ['Hafiz', 'Andy', 'Khurram']

// Define printEach
const printEach = function(words) {
  for (const word of words) {
    console.log(word)
  }
}

/// How many things does this function do
// 1. Loop
// 2. Print

// So perhaps change the name to loopAndPrintEach ?

```

- factor out the printWord and call it in place of console.log
- Problem solved? No; that function is still doing two things indirectly.

- For example what if we want to saveWord?

- The function is still coupled, hard to extend

```js
const names = ['Hafiz', 'Andy', 'Khurram']

const printWord = function (word) {
  console.log(word);
}

const saveWord = function (word) {
  console.log('saving ... 50%');
  console.log('saving ... 99.9999999%');
  console.log('Yaaaas, saved word', word, 'to the cloud! Yes the cloud!!!!');
}


const printEach = function(words) {
  for (const word of words) {
    printWord(word)
  }
}

const saveEach = function(words) {
  for (const word of words) {
    saveWord(word);
  }
}


// const doEach = function(array) {

// }
// WET => Write Every Time

// 1. Loop through the array
// 2. Logs it to console
```

## Callback Intro

```js
// Function to loop through each item and print out the output

const items = [2, 4, 'hello', 'there'];

// there's a JS Array method called forEach
items.forEach(function(item) {
  console.log('item', item);
});

// show non-inline approach as well
items.forEach(printWord);

// In the example above; printWord is called four times by the forEach method
```

## forEach - our style

```js
// Implement our own forEach
const words = ['hello', 'lighthouse', 'world'];

const printWord = function (word, secondArg) {
  console.log(word, secondArg);
}

const saveWord = function (word) {
  console.log('saving ... 50%');
  console.log('saving ... 99.9999999%');
  console.log('Yaaaas, saved word', word, 'to the cloud! Yes the cloud!!!!');
}


// const forEach = function (words, callback) {
//   for (const word of words) {
//     callback(word)
//   }
// }

// This is how the built in array.forEach method behaves in javascript:
// Together with each item in the array, it also passes the index of the item
// and the original array to the callback function.
// Whether the callback function utilizes it, is up to the callback definition.
const forEach = function (words, callback) {
  for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
    callback(word, i, words)
  }
}

forEach(words, printWord)

// With a little tweak, we got ourselves forEach that skips even indices
const forEachOddIndex = function (words, callback) {
  for (let i = 1; i < words.length; i += 2) {
    callback(word, i, words)
  }
}
```

## forEachInReverse

```js
// Implement our own forEach but backwards
const words = ['hello', 'lighthouse', 'world'];

// Implement printEachBackwards without the callback first
// - this is not where we want to be;
// - it's coupled and does multiple things

// Refactor the console.log into printWord
// - still not there, because it's not passed in. So still coupled; we would need to keep this function printWord in here

// Finish it off; pass it as callbacks
```

## map

```js
const map = function (inputArr, callback) {
  // Your code here
  const transformedArr = [];
  for(const item of inputArr) {
    const transformedItem = callback(item)
    transformedArr.push(transformedItem)
  }
  return transformedArr;
}
```

```js
// Test case 1
const input1 = [1, 2, 3];

// ARROW FUNCTION WITH IMPLICIT RETURN
// const squareNum = (num) => num * num

// REGULAR FUNCTION EQUIVALENT OF ABOVE ARROW FUNCTION
// const squareNum = function(num) {
//   return num * num
// }

// ARROW FUNCTION WITH EXPLICIT RETURN
const squareNum = (num) => {
  return num * num
}
console.log(map(input1, squareNum)); // [1, 4, 9]
```

## Things we learned

- Approach: Importance of properly naming things.
- Approach: Importance of knowing how to reading code
- Approach: Incremental approach (EDD)
  - Error Driven Development (KV's baby)
- Functions are first class citizens in JS
  - They can be treated as values and passed around
- This allows us to create more powerful 'generic' functions like forEach, filter, map or reduce

- forEach helps us abstract away the repeatable looping logic
- Higher order functions are functions that takes in other functions as arguments
- We can use inline callbacks especially if it's a one-time use case; otherwise it's better to define the callback function separately
- Functions are first class citizens and can be treated as any other values in javascript
- const / let are block scoped and are not hoisted
- Callback functions caan have any number of arguments for example forEach passes in the index of the current item and the original array
