Final Project Kickoff
===

You folks are awesome. Thanks for sitting through that presentation. I hope it was valuable for you to set you up in the right track.

To summarize main concepts:

- Plan before you start
  - Plan your idea (what to demo - MV~P~D)
  - Plan your workflow
  - Plan to have fun (take care of yourself)
  - Even plan for disaster

- Monitor your progress
  - Daily standups
  - Estimate how long you think things should take
  - Course correct accordingly and regulary

- Communicate
  - with your team mates
  - with mentors and the Education team
  - plan for git too

I preached caution against grandiosity BUT please don't be pedestrian as well. You have the skills to build great stuff, don't cower down - just be realistic.

Here are notes from other instructors that include the slides and resources we chatted about, I highly encourage you to look them over.

Many thanks for putting up with me for the past 10 weeks! Good luck with your finals, I'm already super proud of how far you've come (remember those JS objects week? and callbacks ;)).
