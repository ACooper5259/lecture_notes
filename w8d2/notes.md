## Routing === Transitioning

Stage of routing
 - When you define the routes

 - When you match the route

 ## Context

 // Redux

 // useContext


 ## Things we're taking away
 - Router in one page (Routing in a Single page application)
 - The prebuilt components are definitely useful! Use component libraries e.g material-ui.com, ant-design
 - Libraries to use with React e.g React router, Styled components
 - The ability to easily pass state values across components without props drilling.
