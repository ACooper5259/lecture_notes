W1D4 with Hafiz Suara

## Intro [5m]

- Bootcamp life

- Software parts
 + Logic
 <!-- + Syntax -->
 + Data

## Agenda Today

- [x] Review Object / functions: Challenge
- [x] Functions as values
- [x] Callbacks
- [x] forEachInReverse exercise
- [x] map

## Object Challenge [20m]

- Paste question on slack
- Put teams in breakrooms
- 10mins to get done
- 8mins to review (1min p grp)

## functions as values [20m]

## Callback Intro -> forEach [10m]

## Group work (forEachInReverse) [25m]

[forEachInReverse](https://gist.github.com/hafbau/895ce779fd3b74d51941159a7bf341ae)

Breakout Challenge [25m]
Split into groups and pair program this as a group.
One person starts a VSCode live share and share with the team via the chats or slack.

15m breakout

10m takeup

Each group will be called upon to present their solution. One person will be sharing the screen.

You may run the code to see if it works with the supplied test cases.

I'll check in and give more time if needed.

No need to fork and/or clone this gist. Just copy / paste it into your VSCode

Decide on who will present the answer when called upon for your group

## Questions [5m]

## Things we learned [10m]

- forEach helps us abstract away the repeatable looping logic
- Higher order functions are functions that takes in other functions as arguments
- We can use inline callbacks especially if it's a one-time use case; otherwise it's better to define the callback function separately
- Functions are first class citizens and can be treated as any other values in javascript
- const / let are block scoped and are not hoisted
- Callback functions caan have any number of arguments for example forEach passes in the index of the current item and the original array

Thank you till next time!
