Hey crew,

Thank y'all for your engagements during this lecture and every other ones thus far - it's been a privilege for me, and an experience I looked forward to, every week.

I took a different spin at this lecture. Instead of talking about RSpec and testing in Rails; we chatted about Automated testing in general, the philisophies and whys of testing. We also saw different types of tests, together with their respective pros and cons.

Here are slides for our conversation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1w5t10VVaiVbPt8fqE_Sfcwc2DPRp0UWnp7sLxe7Gses/edit#slide=id.g7740c856ca_0_147

Lastly, and most importantly, thank you and congratulations for making it this far into the program and break a leg on your final projects - or maybe two?

Please don't be strangers, feel free to reach out anytime, hope to keep in touch with as many of you as possible for months/years.

All the best.
