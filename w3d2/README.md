Crud with Express
===

Hey gang, thanks for sitting through today. Our focus today was on the process / workflow of how you begin to write a full web application. We started by planning our ~~million~~ billion dollar idea; _DadCanJokes Inc._ We designed our RESTful routes (Method + Path). We talked about the trifectal of our web server logic:

- Routes / Route Handlers (Controllers)
- Data access / storage (our jokes / users / comments objects)
- Views / Pages the user sees (ejs templates)

[Have a look at the code we wrote here.](https://github.com/hafbau/lecture_notes/tree/master/w3d2/demo)

[I've also included the finished demo code here for completeness.](https://github.com/hafbau/lecture_notes/tree/master/02_14_oct_19/w3d2/_demo_final)

[Have a look at the notes I took in class.](https://github.com/hafbau/lecture_notes/tree/master/w3d2/notes)

[Also, here is note that touched upon some of the details we discussed and more.](https://github.com/NimaBoscarino/crud-express-notes) (Shout out to Nima)
