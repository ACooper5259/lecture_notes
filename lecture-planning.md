4. Current day feedback
5. Think about student stress levels from prev notes etc and then how I'm going to address that. 

## The Build
1. Agenda
2. Timing in Agenda
3. Have all code examples ahead of time (pick a theme/domain)
4. Think about narrative / journey
  - Enables critical thinking 
  - Why is feature X in node created? (Objects)
    - Life without feature X
  - Life with feature X 
5. Notes ahead of time, using code examples from #3 above 
  - Think about the end result of that code (array of arras? one method?). What's the design pattern and complexity ceiling that I want to maintain


10. Send pre written notes, modified to have context about that lecture. Make it personal and relevant. 
  - Make sure YOUR code is also in the notes (separate gist )
