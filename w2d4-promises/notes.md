### Classwork

Agile Manifesto(https://github.com/hafbau/w2d4_classwork)
      + Fork & Clone this repo - All of you
      + Breakout rooms
      + Write your code in the `01_classwork.js`


### Intro to Promises

- Promises are JS objects that are used to handle asynch flow
- They have 3 states
      + pending
      + resolved
      + rejected


### More Promises

+ Error handling
+ Promise.all / Promise.race
+ Make a promise - *We did not get this in class; we did see it in quiz though*
