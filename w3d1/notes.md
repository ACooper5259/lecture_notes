Thanks crew! Here are we talked about today in bullets:

- Intro to Web Servers (Express-less demo)
- Intro to Express
- What is "middleware?"
- Intro to Server-side view templates with EJS

[Code we wrote are here.](https://github.com/hafbau/lecture_notes/tree/master/02_14_oct_19/w3d1) Have a look in the [`old/express_demo/server.js`](https://github.com/hafbau/lecture_notes/blob/master/02_14_oct_19/w3d1/old/express_demo/server.js) and [`old/express_demo/views/index.ejs`](https://github.com/hafbau/lecture_notes/blob/master/02_14_oct_19/w3d1/old/express_demo/views/index.ejs) for EJS (Embedded Javascript).
